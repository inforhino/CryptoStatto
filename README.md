## Crypto Statto - Metrics on the cryptocurrency market

Welcome to crypto statto , our exciting cryptocurrency analytics platform we know the market needs. The team behind crypto statto are experts in cryptocurrency and financial services software.

We have worked in investment banking and for trading exchanges. Working across many areas of the financial market, which we will summarise by both projects and financial area later.

We have not only been exploring different blockchains in terms of their use cases and benefits, but also in terms of blockchain's future viability to streamline financial services in a decentralised fashion. We are uniquely placed to see how the infrastructure of the financial market is ripe for providing autonomous services most retail market participants cannot explore due to the semi-exclusive nature of the financial industry.

Yet, cryptocurrency is plagued by the challenge of extreme price volatility and the obvious paper losses met when the market hits secular bear market cycles.

Our objective is to recognise and embrace this challenge by providing tools and analytics to help provide risk management to more sophisticated investors within the cryptocurrency space. Not only is our platform for sophisticated investors that are commercial operators but also for retail investors hoping to add extra resilience to their position management capacity.

## Cryptocurrency is in the speculation phase

Bitcoin - the grandfather of cryptocurrency, is still in its infancy and has thus had many qualities of money attributed to it.

-   A store of value
-   A medium of exchange
-   A unit of account

  
The reality is, if somebody decided to put £50k into bitcoin, it won't feel like a store of value if that drops to £10k in value. Conversely an investor could invest £10k and find that amount to be worth £50k at some point in the future. This is the speculative store of value. Few could argue it represents a stable store of value.

We would take this a step further and state that because cryptocurrency has such volatility with such downside and upside risk  that it does not make sense to plough significant amounts of fiat money into it because of the faith that it will keep going up.

Despite this contradiction, there is too much technical innovation in the space to ignore that is better than the traditional financial services industry can offer with their legacy approaches to money management.

That cryptocurrency is in the speculation phase means - in our opinion, that cryptocurrency should not need substantial fiat investment to accumulate more cryptocurrency. We think of the speculation phase of cryptocurrency as the chance to not only grow cryptocurrency quantities , but to also draw fiat capital from this investment.

### The move from the age of speculation to the age of stability

There are three outcomes only that cryptocurrency can achieve;

-   Lower volatility and an increase of global capital share
-   Continued volatility and low proportion of global capital share
-   Eventual collapse of cryptocurrency as a failed experiment, reducing inflation in the fiat monetary system

### The importance of transitioning from a speculative store of value to a stable store of value

Whatever happens, we want to at the very least be able to be in a more optimal position than by not having been in cryptocurrency at all. This is our goal with Crypto Statto.
